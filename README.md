DSA - Data Structures and Algorithms ðŸš€
=======================================

This repository provides a collection of data structure and algorithm implementations using **Java** and **C++**. ðŸ§©

Folder Structure Overview ðŸ“‚
----------------------------

The project is organized into multiple directories:

*   **dailyLeetCodeChallenge**: Daily coding challenges for practice.
*   **fundamental**: Core data structures like **Graph**, **Heap**, **Tree**, **LinkedList**, and more.
*   **hackerrank**: Solutions for problems sorted into categories like **array**, **prefix-sum**, **set-map**, etc.
*   **interview**: C++ implementations of common interview questions.
*   **leetcode**: Solutions for LeetCode problems (e.g., `twosum.cpp`).
*   **output**: Temporary files and outputs.

Files like `temp.cpp` and `temp.java` are for quick testing or temporary logic.

* * *

Features ðŸŒŸ
-----------

*   Supports **Java** â˜• and **C++** ðŸ’».
*   Organized and modular structure for learning and practice.
*   Easy to extend for additional problems or algorithms.

* * *

**Happy Coding! ðŸš€âœ¨**
